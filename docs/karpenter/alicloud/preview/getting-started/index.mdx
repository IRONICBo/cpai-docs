**Karpenter** is an open-source node lifecycle management project built for Kubernetes. Adding Karpenter to a Kubernetes cluster can dramatically improve the efficiency and cost of running workloads on that cluster. Karpenter works by:

* **Watching** for pods that the Kubernetes scheduler has marked as unschedulable.
* **Evaluating** scheduling constraints (resource requests, nodeselectors, affinities, tolerations, and topology spread constraints) requested by the pods.
* **Provisioning** nodes that meet the requirements of the pods.
* **Disrupting** the nodes when the nodes are no longer needed.
