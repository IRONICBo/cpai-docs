title: Set up a cluster and add Karpenter
---

**Karpenter** automatically provisions new nodes in response to unschedulable pods. **Karpenter** does this by observing events within the Kubernetes cluster, and then sending commands to the underlying cloud provider.

This guide shows how to get started with Karpenter by installing Karpenter. To use Karpenter, you must be running a supported Kubernetes cluster on Alibaba Cloud provider.

The guide below explains how to utilize the **Karpenter** provider for Alibaba Cloud with ACK.

## Step 1. Install utilities

**Karpenter** requires cloud provider permissions to provision nodes. Currently, Karpenter uses AK/SK credentials (stored as a secret in the cluster) temporarily, but will adopt [RRSA](https://github.com/cloudpilot-ai/karpenter-provider-alicloud/issues/29) in the future to enhance credential security.

Install these tools before proceeding:
* [AlibabaCloud CLI](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/cli/installation-guide/)
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

Run the following command to configure the AlibabaCloud CLI with AK/SK credentials:
```bash
aliyun configure
```

## Step 2. Prepare an Alibaba Cloud ACK cluster

## Step 3. Install Karpenter

## Step 4. Create NodePool/ECSNodeClass

## Step 5. Scale up deployment

## Step 6. Scale down deployment

## Step 7. Uninstall Karpenter
