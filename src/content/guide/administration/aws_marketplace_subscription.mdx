# AWS Marketplace Subscription for `CloudPilot AI`

This guide explains how to activate your `CloudPilot AI` subscription through AWS Marketplace so that every management charge for your AWS-hosted Kubernetes clusters is consolidated into your regular AWS bill.

## Prerequisites

- You have an AWS account with permission to purchase Marketplace products (for example, the `AWSMarketplaceManageSubscriptions` managed policy).
- You can sign in to the `CloudPilot AI` console, or you are ready to create a new `CloudPilot AI` account.

## Step 1: Locate `CloudPilot AI` in AWS Marketplace

Click the button to open the `CloudPilot AI` console.
- If you're already signed in, `CloudPilot AI` will automatically link the subscription to your account.
- Otherwise, sign in or register, and `CloudPilot AI` completes the link once authentication finishes.

    You can review `CloudPilot AI` charges anytime in **AWS Billing → Bills → Marketplace**, alongside your other AWS services.

    `CloudPilot AI` automatically reports the average vCPU count across the nodes it manages to AWS Marketplace each hour to calculate your bill.
